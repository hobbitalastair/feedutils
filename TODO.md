# TODO

- Implement a test suite with any pathological examples I can find.
  Perhaps do some fuzzing too?
- Provide a curl wrapper recognizing a 200-code response.
- Provide some example open, fetch scripts.
- Add helpers for detecting old (dead) feeds.

- Implement support for filtering and tagging feeds.
- Allow filtering feed-read and feed-update.
- Implement support for batching updates (eg only read if the oldest unread
  is older than a month).
